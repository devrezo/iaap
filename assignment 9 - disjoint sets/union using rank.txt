void union_set(int data1, int data2, struct tnode **root_ref) {
	struct node *n1 = NULL;
	struct node *n2 = NULL;
	struct node *rep1 = NULL;
	struct node *rep2 = NULL;

	n1 = get(data1, root_ref);
	n2 = get(data2, root_ref);
	rep1 = find_set(n1);
	rep2 = find_set(n2);

	check for null conditions here and proceed with union rank if
	the conditions are satisfied. 

	in the union operation, we integrate the set with lower rank 
	into the set with higher rank 

	if (rep2->rank >= rep1->rank) {
		if (rep1->rank == rep2->rank) {
			rep1->rank =+1;
			rep2->representative = rep1;
		}
		else {
			here if the second set is not having the same rank
			as that of the first set, integrate the smaller set by
			making the first set representative 
			rep2->representative = rep1;
		}
	}
	else {
		this means that the rank of the second set is greater than
		the rank of the first set.
		so integrate the first set into the second set by making the
		representative of the second set as the representative of the
		first.
		rep1->representative = rep2;
		 take a small example and comprehend.
	}
